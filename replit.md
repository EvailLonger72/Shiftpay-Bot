# Burmese Salary Calculator Telegram Bot

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Telegram bot that calculates daily salary for factory workers in Myanmar. The bot automatically detects shift types (Day/Night), correctly deducts break times, and calculates wages including overtime and night overtime rates. The system now includes advanced features like goal tracking, data export, performance analytics, work streak monitoring, and personalized notifications. All responses are formatted in Burmese language for local users.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Telegram Bot Interface**: Handles user interactions and message processing
- **Salary Calculator**: Core business logic for wage calculations
- **Shift Detector**: Identifies shift types and manages break schedules
- **Time Utilities**: Handles time parsing and calculations
- **Burmese Formatter**: Formats responses in Burmese language
- **Analytics System**: Comprehensive analytics with charts and statistics
- **Data Storage**: Persistent user data storage and management
- **Export Manager**: CSV/JSON data export functionality
- **Goal Tracker**: Monthly/weekly goal setting and progress tracking
- **Notification Manager**: Work reminders and performance alerts
- **Calendar Manager**: Event scheduling and salary payment date tracking

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with python-telegram-bot library
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **External APIs**: Telegram Bot API
- **No Database**: Stateless design, processes each request independently

## Key Components

### 1. SalaryTelegramBot (main.py)
- **Purpose**: Main bot controller and Telegram API interface
- **Key Features**:
  - Handles /start and /help commands
  - Processes time input messages
  - Integrates calculator and formatter components
- **Architecture Decision**: Uses async/await pattern for Telegram API calls to handle concurrent users efficiently

### 2. SalaryCalculator (salary_calculator.py)
- **Purpose**: Core business logic for salary calculations
- **Key Features**:
  - Calculates total work minutes
  - Handles break deductions
  - Splits hours into regular, overtime, and night overtime
  - Applies correct wage rates (¬•2,100 regular, ¬•2,625 night OT)
- **Architecture Decision**: Separates calculation logic from presentation for better maintainability

### 3. ShiftDetector (shift_detector.py)
- **Purpose**: Identifies shift types and manages break schedules
- **Key Features**:
  - Detects C341 (Day Shift) and C342 (Night Shift)
  - Manages break time configurations
  - Handles cross-midnight shifts
- **Architecture Decision**: Centralized shift configuration allows easy addition of new shifts

### 4. TimeUtils (time_utils.py)
- **Purpose**: Utility functions for time parsing and calculations
- **Key Features**:
  - Parses HH:MM format input
  - Handles cross-midnight time calculations
  - Calculates overlaps between work and break times
- **Architecture Decision**: Separate utility class promotes code reuse and testability

### 5. BurmeseFormatter (burmese_formatter.py)
- **Purpose**: Formats calculation results into Burmese Telegram messages
- **Key Features**:
  - Formats salary breakdowns in Burmese
  - Creates visual diagrams for work time
  - Handles error message formatting
- **Architecture Decision**: Separate formatter allows easy localization and message customization

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User sends time range (e.g., "08:30 ~ 17:30")
2. **Time Parsing**: TimeUtils parses the input into datetime objects
3. **Shift Detection**: ShiftDetector identifies the shift type and break schedule
4. **Salary Calculation**: SalaryCalculator computes wages with proper deductions
5. **Response Formatting**: BurmeseFormatter creates localized response
6. **Message Delivery**: Bot sends formatted message back to user

## External Dependencies

- **python-telegram-bot**: Official Telegram Bot API wrapper
- **datetime**: Python standard library for time handling
- **logging**: Python standard library for error tracking
- **typing**: Python standard library for type hints

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Requires Telegram Bot Token from BotFather
- No database setup required (stateless design)
- Minimal server requirements due to lightweight architecture

### Configuration
- Bot token stored in environment variables
- Shift configurations hardcoded in ShiftDetector class
- Salary rates configured in SalaryCalculator class

### Scaling Considerations
- Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
- Each request processed independently
- No persistent storage requirements
